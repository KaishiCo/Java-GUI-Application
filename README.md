## Description
- This project is a test bench for me to learn the ins-and-outs of creating GUI applications in Java.
- I will be adding more things as the time goes on.
- The project currently interacts with an API made by Marc (umizu). 
- The goal at this current time is for there to be a login system, a task creation screen, and an interface with all the tasks for the current week.
